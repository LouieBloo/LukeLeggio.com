				<p class='GlobalFont MemberHead Orange'>Background:</p>
			
				<p class='GlobalFont MemberDescription'>
					Dr. Lau entered into the chiropractic health care field after a personal experience he had with extreme low back pain. While training for a full contact kickboxing tournament, he suffered a severe strain to his low back. After physical therapy and medical interventions did not resolve his pain or his condition, one of his students recommended Chiropractic. He was amazed to find that within a few treatments, he was out of pain and training again. It was the first time he was out of pain in over 6 months. From that point, he immediately made a career change. Originally on the academic route towards becoming a Physical Therapist, he was motivated by the power of the human body and the amazing level of healing the body can perform when allowed to do so without interference from outside sources.

				<p class='GlobalFont MemberHead Orange'>Education:</p>
					<p class='GlobalFont MemberDescription'>
						Dr. Lau completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California in Davis, where he earned a bachelor's degree in Exercise Physiology. He then completed his doctoral studies at Palmer College of Chiropractic West where he graduated with Cum Laude honors. During his studies, he performed a 1-year internship with a well-recognized sports chiropractor, Nick Athens (chiropractor for the SF Giants currently and most of the 49ers from the 80's-early 90's) and continued onto a 9-month preceptorship with Dr's Matthew and Michael Janzen (chiropractors for Ultimate Fighting Champions, professional triathletes and Olympic medallists). Both of these clinics gave him the opportunity to work with high-level and elite athletes of all types.

				<p class='GlobalFont MemberHead Orange'>Background:</p>
			
				<p class='GlobalFont MemberDescription'>
					Dr. Scott Saberniak is originally from Northwest Indiana and moved to California in 2009. Growing up as a student and a multi-sport athlete, he has always had a passion for learning about the human body and how it performs. Although he may not have known it at the time, he learned from his coaches at a young age how to move with efficiency. This quality that has made him an exceptional athlete and more importantly has enhanced his overall health and well-being today. Dr. Scott entered into the chiropractic profession with an in-depth knowledge about the study of human movement which he obtained from his undergraduate training and experience as an athlete.

From his professional experience, he learned that if he applied the same principles of movement quality and efficiency that made him succeed as an athlete, to his patients, they healed quicker. He found that chronic pain such as tendonosis or even acute pain like an ankle sprain can be attributed to whole body weaknesses or subtle imbalances. After these poor movement abilities are identified in his patients, Dr. Scott begins to correct them with the assist of the appropriate soft tissue treatments, chiropractic therapy, and training proper movements. This process has proven to be the key to helping his patients become pain free and function at their full potential.
