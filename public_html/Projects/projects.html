					<p class="paragraphText">Eggbryo is the latest game I’ve been working on in my free time. It is a quick paced game with a simple task; 
						save the eggs before they freeze to death. The player must switch between the colored boxes on either 
						side of the screen before they can click an egg. If you have the wrong colored box selected and you click an egg
						that egg will die. There are many kinds of eggs and even a few powerups to help the player.</p>

						over each pixel on the source picture, finding the source folder picture that best matches that pixel
						 color, and then creating a giant image from the results.</p>

					<p class="paragraphText">The Last Dawn and Base Defense were the first two games I ever created.
						 These games were written entirely in C++ and use the SDL2 libraries to display the graphics. 
						 The engine for the games were written from scratch, and include features such as: dynamic A* pathfinding/movement,
						  automated turrets, walls, particles, weapon pickups, item pickups, health systems, upgrade systems, reloading, minimaps, and collision detection.</p>
					
					
					
					<img class='screenshotMiddle' title"Base Defense Screenshot" src='../Pictures/baseDefense.png'>
					
					<p class="paragraphText">I was writing the engine and making the games simultaneously; therefore, there wasn't a whole lot to do in either of them. I quickly moved on to 
						developing within Unity as it took a lot of the overhead out of the equation. I put these games up mainly to display where I’ve come from, and to
						show that I have a deeper understanding of game engines aside from just using them.</p>

						had my updated engine and the A* pathfinding. This is an EXTREME prototype! There is barely any functionality other than picking up weapons, shooting, and opening the backpack.
